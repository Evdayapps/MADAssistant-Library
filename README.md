# MADAssistant-Library
Mobile Android Debugging Assistant  
Library for integration in applications.


## What is it
MADAssistant is an on-device solution for logging information from client apps, for diagnostics and auditing.</br> 
The main goal of this project is to enable audit and logging of app events for later analysis, without the need for desktop software.</br>
It achieves this by pairing with a companion app [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evdayapps.madassistant.repository] which serves as the repository for the logs.</br>
By collecting all the different logs, it aims to provide a clear track of events which aid resolution of any issues.</br>


## What can it log
The library currently provides logging for the following types of events:
- Network Logs
- Analytics Calls
- Exceptions and Crashes
- Generics Logs


## Who does it benefit
The library aims to provide utility to users across the SDLC, from developers to end-users.
- Quality Assurance - By integrating it into test builds, it can serve as a log of every session, and log any crashes that might occur.
- Product Owners - Logging of analytics events help in auditing builds for proper implementation of analytics events
- Developers - Varies utility with all the different logs
- End Users - This library can even be integrated into production builds, to enable debugging of issues on a client's device



## Security
In order to receive logs, the user has to first share an encrypted authToken, generated by the developer.</br>
This authToken encapsulates the following information:
- The user's installation identifier (a uuid generated by the MADAssistant app once per installation)
- An optional start and end time
- The logs accessible to the user (with fine-grained regex-based filters)

All this information needs to be encrypted using the same passphrase, which is then decrypted by the library upon receipt.</br>
Logs are filtered client-side before transmission to the MADAssistant app.


## What exactly is logged
As stated earlier, the logs are:
- Network Calls
- Analytics Events
- Exceptions and Crash reports
- General Android android.util.Log logs


### Network Logs

- **Parameters** - The payload for the event

Filters:
- **Destination Name** - (Regex) Name of the destination
- **Event Name** - (Regex) Name of the event
- **Parameters** - (Regex) The parameters, as a json string

### Exceptions and Crashes
Crashes can be auto logged by calling the connectExceptionHandler method
Properties:
- **Thread Name** - The name of the thread on which it occured

### Generic Logs
Can be used for general logging.  
Supports all log types as per android.utils.Log

Properties:
- **Type** - The type of the log, matching android.utils.Log

## Integration into your application
- Add jitpack support
  ```
  allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
  ```
- Add the library as a dependency
  ```
  implementation 'com.github.Evdayapps:MADAssistant-Library:0.0.7'
  ```
- Create an instance of MADAssistantClient
  ```
  val client = MADAssistantClient(
    
  )
  ```
- Call the appropriate logging methods
  ```
  client.
  ```
